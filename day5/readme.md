# Bashcrawl

Make sure you have done an intro to bash and then open a bash terminal up and running that can be on Windows, Linux, Mac - your preference

Open up your bash terminal and git clone the following:

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/slackermedia/bashcrawl.git bashcrawl
```

Then cd into the bashcrawl directory.

Read the README.me file and start the game!

FYI - for mac users you may have an issue with some of the files. Have a look at this for help: https://gitlab.com/slackermedia/bashcrawl
